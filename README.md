# Office-Mate-Checker

## Purpose of application

Application is a concept of checking your team/workmate availability status. You can simply search for him by name and found current status.

## How to run it

We have two independent projects here for backend and frontend. However, we've increased DX by integrating them with one package. 
You can simply run in  with standard yarn commands ( in case you don't have it=> npm install yarn -g):

### `yarn`
then
### `yarn start`

then frontend and backend should start in one terminal.

Otherwise, you can start them separately:

"client" is for frontend app and can be run with standard yarn commands ( in case you don't have it=> npm install yarn -g):

### `yarn`
then
### `yarn start`

It should start at http://localhost:3000 by default.


In the case of backend, you can simply run it by "yarn" and "yarn start" commands. In case of developing stuff in the backend, it's better to run it with "yarn run dev" because in the case of any code changes, the server will restart automatically.

It should start at http://localhost:5000 by default.
